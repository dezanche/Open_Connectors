This connector is intended for use with MRI radio frequency coils that operate in transmit/receive mode and supports a maximum of 2 coaxial connections. Thanks to an edge connector, it is possible to transmit and receive up to 36 DC or logic signals. System- and coil-side 3D-printed mating plates protect the contacts and include ramps that assist with alignment and mating of the two halves. Correct alignment is further ensured by alignement pins.

Insertion loss of the coaxial contacts is better than 0.1 dB up to 200 MHz and better than 0.2 dB up to 500 MHz.

Approximate cost of all materials used for the prototype is $20 (USD).
