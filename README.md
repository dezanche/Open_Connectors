# Open_Connectors
Designs for 3D-printed modular RF connectors for accessible, low-cost magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

## Projects List

### open_TR_RF_coil_connector
<img src="https://github.com/dezanche/Open_Connectors/blob/main/pictures/open_TR_RF_coil_connector.png?raw=true" width="100">

This connector is intended for use with MRI radio frequency coils that operate in transmit/receive mode and supports a maximum of 2 coaxial connections. Thanks to an edge connector, it is possible to transmit and receive up to 36 DC or logic signals. System- and coil-side 3D-printed mating plates protect the contacts and include ramps that assist with alignment and mating of the two halves. Correct alignment is further ensured by alignement pins.

Insertion loss of the coaxial contacts is better than 0.1 dB up to 200 MHz and better than 0.2 dB up to 500 MHz.

Approximate cost of all materials used for the prototype is $20 (USD).

### OSII-RF-Coil-Connector

This connector is optimized for the use with the [OSI<sup>2</sup> MRI Low Field scanner](https://www.opensourceimaging.org/project/osii-one/). The connector is intended for use with 1 channel Tx/Rx MRI radio frequency coils. Thanks to an edge connector, it is possible to transmit and receive up to 36 DC or logic signals. System- and coil-side 3D-printed mating plates protect the contacts and include ramps that assist with alignment and mating of the two halves. Correct alignment is further ensured by alignement pins. The connector is provided with a locking mechanism to maintain contact in case of vibrations or minor accidental force on the cable. Furthermore, the system-side part provides a dust cover to protect circuitry when the RF coil is disconnected.

Insertion loss of the coaxial contacts is better than 0.1 dB up to 200 MHz and better than 0.2 dB up to 500 MHz.

The connector boards comply with the *Physical Layer* of the [MRCODS Open Standard](https://github.com/umbertozanovello/OpenStandard-CoilID/tree/main) (MRI RF Coil Open Data Standard).

Approximate cost of all materials used for the prototype is $55 (USD).
